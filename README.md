# Clocktower Companion Frontend
This is the client side of a Twitch extension for streamed games of Blood on the Clocktower.

## Features
* Displays character ability text to viewers when hovering over the corresponding location of the stream.

## Roadmap
* Synchronize stream delay
* Add Demon bluffs and Fabled to the overlay
* Add a toggleable listing for all roles on the script, similar to what players might see when pressing 'R' in the clocktower app.
